_nothing new to show for… yet!_

## [0.1.0]

- date: 2019-08-02
- name: GFX Tutorial, Part I

### Description

The first in a long sequence of _prototyping releases_. Every release will
change a tiny bit of the application, starting with nothing related to the game
at all, slowly building towards something that takes on a familiar shape,
representing what is described in the design documentation.

In the first couple of releases, the GFX tutorial is completed step by step, to
get a feel for the low-level graphics programming requirements.
